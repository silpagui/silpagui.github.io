## About Me
A front end developer, encouraged to challenges and focused to learn and apply.

During my years being a Technical college teacher, and being really close to different technologies, I used to be up to the latest software trends. Afterwards, I started my journey to HTML, CSS, Javascript and popular libraries such as React.js, now I feel ready to start a new position.

By having my background as a teacher, I've realised that for any new developer how hard it is to find a clear path on different courses related to front end development, but I never stopped, I built my career by using resources and tech communityâ€™s help.

Reading a ton of books, papers and improving my skills every day, not with brute force but with a lot of critical thinking and practice I can say with confidence that I can bring value to a project, I am a doer.

Specialties: Front End development, internal/external trainer, soft skills, fast adaptability, fast learning.

**Technical Skills**: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, Axios, SCSS, Git

Responsive web page from devchallenge.io. Challenging myself with a more complex website, interacting with geolocation Web API, creating promises from scratch and using a popular client library [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
