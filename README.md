## About Me

A front end developer, encouraged to challenges and focused to learn and apply.

During my years being a Technical college teacher, and being really close to different technologies, I used to be up to the latest software trends. Afterwards, I started my journey to HTML, CSS, Javascript and popular libraries such as React.js, now I feel ready to start a new position.

By having my background as a teacher, I've realised that for any new developer how hard it is to find a clear path on different courses related to front end development, but I never stopped, I built my career by using resources and tech communityâ€™s help.

Reading a ton of books, papers and improving my skills every day, without brute force but with a lot of critical thinking and practice I can say with confidence that I can bring value to a project, I am a doer.

**Specialties**: Front End development, internal/external trainer, soft skills, fast adaptability, fast learning.

**Technical Skills**: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, Axios, SCSS, Git, Figma

Responsive web page from devchallenge.io. Challenging myself with a more complex website, interacting with geolocation Web API, creating promises from scratch and using a popular client library [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

The main focus was to compose my code in a way that my components are simpler and handles less logic understanding the concept of "modules" in js. Starting thinking on data flows and manage multiple side effects by using useEffect and local states.

**Technologies used:**
React, Javascript ( Includes Geolocation Web API, Promises ), Axios, HTML5, CSS3, Figma
