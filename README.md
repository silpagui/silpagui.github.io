## About Me

I am a fullstack developer, encouraged by challenges and focused on learning and applying knowledge.

During my years as a Technical College Teacher, and being really close to different technologies, I was always up to date on the latest software trends. Afterwards, I started my journey to HTML, CSS, Javascript and popular libraries such as React.js. Now, I feel ready to start a new position.

By having my background as a teacher, I've realised how hard it is for any new developer to find a clear path on one of the different courses related to front end development, but I never stopped; I built my career by using resources and the tech communityâ€™s help.

Reading a ton of books and papers, with a lot of critical thinking and practice improving my skills every day. I can say with confidence that I can bring value to a project, and that I am a doer.

**Specialties**: Fullstack development, internal/external trainer, soft skills, fast adaptability, fast learning.

**Technical Skills**: React, Redux, Typescript, React Router DOM, Node, Express, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Axios, SCSS, Git, Figma

Responsive web page from devchallenge.io. Challenging myself with a more complex website, interacting with geolocation Web API, creating promises from scratch and using a popular client library [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

The main focus was to compose my code so that my components would be simpler and handle less logic, thus understanding the concept of "modules" in js. Here I started by thinking about data flows and managing multiple side effects by using useEffect and local states.

**Technologies used:**
React, Javascript ( Includes Geolocation Web API, Promises ), Axios, HTML5, CSS3, Figma
